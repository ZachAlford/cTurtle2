Included in the submission file is the paper, an example file in our language (House.txt), 
our grammer (cTurtle2.g4), the Translator files we wrote (Translator.stg and Translator.java),
example output (House.py), Screenshots for this example (Screenshot of the house example . docx).
Finally, the files that are necessary to use our language are in the folder "FolderContainingFilesForExecution";
this folder contains the java files necessary after compilation, where Translator.java contains the main() function of the program.
